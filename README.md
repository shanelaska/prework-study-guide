# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
My motivitation for this project was to further my understanding of coding before beginning my coding bootcamp. I built this project so I could utilize the basic coding concepts such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I succesfully created a website that not only helped me further my understanding of these concepts but also includes useful information as a study guide. I've learned HTML formatting that gives the website structure, CSS tools that give the website styling, and javaScript methods that give the website functionality. 
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
